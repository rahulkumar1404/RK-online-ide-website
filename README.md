Project title: RK online ide website;

Project description:
Online compilers are very easy to fire up and use with a web browser and an active internet connection and thatâ€™s all. Compile, save your code, and access it from anywhere without any overhead of management and resource limitation. These web-based applications can be used remotely through any network connection, or devices (platform-independent). The errors/Output of the compiled program can be stored more conveniently. so here I made my a small project in the guidance of Fututre Ready Talent Azure Internship Program this website is only support java script lang or others not.
